//! Outbound-socket protector hook for Android `VpnService.protect(fd)`.
//!
//! When meow-rs runs *inside* an Android VPN app, every outbound socket it
//! opens must bypass the VPN itself — otherwise packets to proxy upstreams
//! loop back into the tunnel and deadlock. Android exposes a per-fd hook
//! for this: `android.net.VpnService.protect(int fd)`. This module is the
//! single place the JNI bridge installs that hook; the proxy adapters that
//! open outbound sockets dial through [`connect_tcp`] / [`connect_tcp_host`]
//! / [`bind_udp`], which call the installed protector before `connect()` /
//! `bind()` so the very first SYN / UDP packet already bypasses the tunnel.
//!
//! ## Why the second hook (`HostResolver`)
//!
//! `VpnService.protect(fd)` only protects sockets meow-rs creates itself.
//! Libc's `getaddrinfo` (called by `tokio::net::lookup_host` and
//! `TcpStream::connect("host:port")`) opens its own DNS sockets that
//! meow-rs never sees, so on a VPN-active device those DNS queries route
//! *through* the VPN — i.e. through meow-rs's own tunnel — which then needs
//! to dial a proxy upstream, which needs DNS, which loops. To break that
//! loop, [`connect_tcp_host`] consults an optionally-installed
//! `HostResolver` (typically backed by meow-rs's own `meow_dns::Resolver`
//! whose upstream sockets *are* protected) before falling back to the
//! system resolver.
//!
//! The `SocketProtector` (raw-fd) hook is compiled only on Android in
//! production — that's the platform whose VPN model demands it; for tests we
//! also enable it on any unix host so CI can exercise it against real
//! loopback sockets. The `HostResolver` hook carries no platform dependency
//! and is compiled everywhere: Android installs it alongside the protector,
//! iOS installs it on its own (the NE process needs the off-tunnel, async,
//! coalesced resolution but not raw-fd protection).

// ─── Host-resolver hook (cross-platform) ──────────────────────────────────
//
// Unlike the `SocketProtector` (which protects raw fds and is meaningful only
// inside Android's `VpnService` model — see the `android` module below), the
// hostname→IP hook is useful on every VPN platform. Routing a hostname dial
// through meow-rs's own `meow_dns::Resolver` (whose upstream sockets either
// bypass the tunnel or are protected) instead of libc's `getaddrinfo` gives
// us three things the system resolver can't: it never loops a lookup back
// through our own tunnel, it runs fully async (no blocking-pool thread per
// `getaddrinfo`, so a wake-time burst of dials can't exhaust the pool), and
// it coalesces + caches concurrent lookups for the same host. The registry
// itself carries no platform dependency, so it is compiled unconditionally;
// only the *installation* is platform-specific (Android JNI bridge / iOS FFI
// engine start).

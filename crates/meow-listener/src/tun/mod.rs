//! TUN inbound — transparent proxying via an L3 device (issue #326).
//!
//! This is the transparent-proxy path for platforms without a
//! tproxy/REDIRECT firewall — Windows first and foremost — and works the
//! same on Linux and macOS. A `tun-rs` device receives raw IP packets; the
//! lwIP userspace TCP/IP stack ([`lwip`](https://github.com/madeye/lwip))
//! terminates them and hands us ordinary `AsyncRead + AsyncWrite` streams
//! (TCP) and a packet-level UDP socket, which are dispatched into the
//! tunnel exactly like every other inbound.
//!
//! lwIP's accept hook runs only after the TCP handshake, so a SYN-only
//! packet never becomes a `TcpStream`. PCB / window / heap caps live in
//! that crate's `lwipopts.h` (`MEMP_NUM_TCP_PCB`, `TCP_WND`, `MEM_SIZE`).
//! An accepted flow then gets a short sniff window (`TUN_SNIFF_WINDOW`,
//! 200 ms) for the client's first bytes, which are replayed upstream as
//! the relay prefix. A flow that closes or resets inside the window
//! (connect scans, aborted reconnects) is dropped before rule-match /
//! stats / dial. A flow that stays silent is dialed anyway with an empty
//! prefix: server-first protocols (SMTP, POP3, IMAP, FTP, MySQL, VNC,
//! SSH) wait for the server's banner and would otherwise never get one
//! (#695).
//!
//! ## Loop freedom (v1: fake-IP-scoped capture)
//!
//! The classic TUN failure mode is the routing loop: a global default route
//! into the device makes meow's *own* outbound dials re-enter the tun. v1
//! avoids the whole problem class by capturing only the fake-IP range:
//!
//! 1. The OS resolver is pointed at an address inside the routed range, so
//!    DNS queries enter the tun and `dns-hijack` answers them with fake IPs.
//! 2. Client connections to those fake IPs route into the tun; the fake-IP
//!    rewrite recovers the hostname and rules match on domain.
//! 3. Outbound dials — proxy upstreams *and* DIRECT — go to real IPs, which
//!    are never inside the fake range, so they take the physical route and
//!    cannot loop. No SO_MARK, interface binding, or bypass routes needed.
//!
//! The trade-off: IP-literal traffic (no DNS lookup) is not captured.
//!
//! ## Global route scope (#375, experimental)
//!
//! [`TunRouteScope::Global`] opts into capturing everything: `auto-route`
//! installs split default routes (`0.0.0.0/1` + `128.0.0.0/1`, plus
//! `::/1` + `8000::/1` when the device has an `inet6-address`; on macOS an
//! equivalent set that avoids the all-zero destination), and loop
//! freedom moves from route scoping to the outbound path — every socket
//! meow creates is bound to the physical interface
//! (`meow_common::install_outbound_interface`: `SO_BINDTODEVICE` on Linux,
//! `IP_BOUND_IF` on macOS, `IP_UNICAST_IF` on Windows) before
//! connect/bind, and hostname dials resolve through meow's own resolver
//! hook. Startup fails closed if the binding cannot be installed.
//!
//! On Windows the device is a Wintun adapter. `wintun.dll` is resolved next
//! to the executable (official Windows zips ship it there), then the working
//! directory; if neither exists the official signed DLL embedded in the
//! binary is written out. The process must run elevated. On Linux/macOS
//! creating the device requires root (CAP_NET_ADMIN).
